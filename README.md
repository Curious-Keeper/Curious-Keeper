*Not a dev by trade, but that hasn't stopped me from wrangling workflows, whispering to CRMs, or yelling at APIs until they blink first.*

## Current Quest

Building **P.E.P.P.E.R.**—an internal knowledge base that trains a proprietary AI to actually *understand* business consulting. Think: a digital brain that absorbs institutional knowledge and spits out insights that don't sound like a LinkedIn post wrote them.

> *"What if we taught an AI everything we know... and it still asked better questions than the interns?"*

## 🧪 Operating Philosophy

I exist somewhere between:

| State | Vibe |
|-------|------|
| 🔬 | *"This shouldn't work, but it does"* |
| 📝 | *"Maybe I should've documented that"* |
| 🔥 | *"Please ignore the smoke, it's just innovation"* |
| 🌙 | *"It's 3am and I'm debugging someone else's dream"* |

## 🛠️ Things I Break, Fix & Build

```text
├── 🤖 AI agents that mostly help (occasionally hallucinate)
├── 🔧 Custom CRMs held together by n8n and sheer will
├── 📊 Lead scoring systems that don't lie (unless asked nicely)
├── ⚡ Automation that scales until it spontaneously combusts
└── 🎯 SaaS stuff that works (even when it shouldn't)
```

> **Note:** Hire me to stress-test your SaaS. If it has AI and buttons, I can probably make it think it's hosting SNL instead of running your business.
