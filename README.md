# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm @Curious-Keeper  

## ðŸš€ About Me  
Freelancer, founder, and automation enthusiast on a mission to **fix the broken freelance marketplace** with 8thDegreeâ€”an **open-source, AI-driven** talent connection platform. Not a developer by trade, but between **AI, automation, and sheer persistence**, I build things that work (most of the time).  

I specialize in:  
âœ… **Workflow automation & integrations**  
âœ… **Lead ranking & CRM customization**  
âœ… **Building a fair and transparent freelance ecosystem** 
âœ… **AI AGents and helpful business tools**

## ðŸŒ± Currently Learning  
- How to **not break everything** while integrating AI-powered automations  
- Finding the balance between **"It works!"** and **"Why did it break again?"**  
- Scaling **8thDegree** without losing my mind  

## ðŸ’¡ Open to Collaborations  
If you've ever cursed an API at 3 AM or debugged the same issue 10 times before realizing it was a typo, we should probably talk.  
Open to collaborating on:  
ðŸ”¹ **Automation workflows & AI-powered tools**  
ðŸ”¹ **Open-source projects (especially in freelancing & SaaS)**  
ðŸ”¹ **Scalability, lead ranking, CRM optimizations, workflows, and integrations**  

## ðŸ“« How to Reach Me  
- **GitHub Issues:** Ping me in any of my repos  
- **Email:** (One day, when Iâ€™m not buried in tasks)  
- **Telepathy:** Still in beta, but worth a shot  

## âš¡ Fun Fact  
Despite everything, I still believe in automation making life **easier**â€”even when it occasionally makes me question my existence.
