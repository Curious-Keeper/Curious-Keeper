# 👋 Hey there, I'm @Curious-Keeper  

## 👀 About Me  
Just a relentless problem-solver navigating the world of automation, lead ranking, and CRM integrations—one debug at a time. Not a developer by trade, but with the help of AI (and sheer stubbornness), I somehow manage to make things work.  

## 🌱 Currently Learning  
- How **not** to pull my hair out over parser nodes in n8n  
- The art of automation without breaking things (too often)  
- Finding the perfect balance between **"I got this"** and **"Why isn't this working?"**  

## 💞️ Looking to Collaborate On  
If you’ve ever whispered *"Why does this API hate me?"* into the void at 3 AM, we should probably talk. Open to teaming up on:  
- Workflow automation & integrations  
- CRM customizations & lead ranking  
- Anything that saves me (or someone else) from another endless debugging session  

## 📫 How to Reach Me  
- GitHub Issues: Drop a message in any of my repos  
- Email: (Maybe one day when I’m not drowning in tasks)  
- Telepathy: Still in beta, but open to testing  

## ⚡ Fun Fact  
Despite everything, I still believe in automation making life *easier*—even if it occasionally makes me question my life choices.
