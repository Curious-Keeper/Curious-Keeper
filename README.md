## 🧠 About Me

AI-fueled **mad scientist**, accidental **prompt sorcerer**, and full-time **startup survivor**.  
Currently building **8thDegree**—an open-source, AI-powered platform to un-break the freelance ecosystem (or at least distract it with shiny buttons and automation until it behaves).

Not a dev by trade, but that hasn’t stopped me from wrangling workflows, whispering to CRMs, or yelling at APIs until they blink first.

I operate somewhere between:
- 🧪 *“This shouldn’t work, but it does”*
- 🧘 *“Maybe I should’ve documented that”*
- 🔥 *“Please ignore the smoke, it’s just innovation”*

## 🛠️ I Break/Fix/Build:
- AI agents that mostly help and occasionally hallucinate
- Custom CRMs with duct tape, Zapier, and pure willpower
- Lead scoring systems that don’t lie (unless you ask nicely)
- Automation that scales until it spontaneously combusts
- SaaS stuff that isn’t boring (and some that is, but it works)
- Note: Hire me to break your saas, if it has AI and it has buttons,
  I can probably make it think it's on SNL and not your system

## ⚡ Currently Experimenting With:
- Using **AI + no-code** tools to ship faster than my imposter syndrome
- Taming chaos with clean prompts and messy notebooks
- Pushing boundaries without pushing felonies  
- Running my own platform while selling hoodies about failing to run my own platform

---

## 🧩 Looking to Collaborate On:
- AI tools that actually solve something
- Automation that isn’t just “add to Google Sheet”
- Bug bounty-adjacent research (the legal, helpful kind)
- Projects where “founder” also means janitor, therapist, and late-night debugger

---

## 📬 Contact
- GitHub issues work, but psychic messages are faster  
- Email? You’ll know it when the time is right (or when I remember to set it up)  
- If you're lost in a sea of SaaS despair, I'm probably already there or driving the boat

## 🥲 Fun Fact
I’ve built at least 3 platforms, 17 hoodie ideas, and 0 savings accounts.  
But hey, I’ve got good prompts, questionable sleep habits, and a sarcastic AI sidekick.
